# Binary Trees

In this Repository, I am studying Binary Trees in C.


## Documentation

binary_trees.h: This is the header file that defines the necessary structures and function prototypes for binary trees. It includes the basic binary_tree_t structure, as well as typedefs for different types of binary trees (bst_t, avl_t, heap_t). It also includes the function prototypes for the functions defined in the .c file.

## Usage/Examples

```c
❯ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 0-main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 0-node
❯ ./0-node
       .-------(098)-------.
  .--(012)--.         .--(402)--.
(006)     (016)     (256)     (512)
